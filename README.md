# Basic DLL Injector
This is the simplest kind of a C# WinForms dll injector you can make.

UI Frontend made with my WinForms UI Library CuoreUI - https://github.com/1Kxhu/CuoreUI

You're probably only interested in the Injector.cs class: https://github.com/1Kxhu/basic-dll-injector/blob/master/basic%20dll%20injector/Injector.cs
